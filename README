## Goal

QuackiQuacki or quackiquacki is primary a proof-of-concept. It's goal is to provide the ability to navigate through the web and on websites only with your speech and to transform the content on websites, especially "Web 2.0" websites and web applications, to natural speech. 

It's heavily inspired by "Saria", a tool for controlling the PC and executing simple tasks via your speech, written by [Papierkorb](http://github.com/papierkorb).

Currently it is under heavy development.
